// Exercise1.4.2.cpp
//Basic C program that asks for text input from the keyboard. 
//The output of this program should be the amount of characters, the amount of words and the amount of newlines that have been typed. 
//Multiple consecutive spaces should not be counted as multiple words.
//This one uses DO WHILE LOOP
//
//


// Preprocessor for include files
#include <stdio.h>			// C style I/O
#include <ctype.h>          //This include file declares the narrow character (char) classification functionality.
