//Exercise1.7.4.cpp
//Basic C program that has a function DayName()which can print the day of a given day-number.

//Need to use _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS to avoid compilation errors. Seems that scanf is now deprecated.

// Preprocessor for include files
#include <stdio.h>			// C style I/O

//DayName() function 
//Purpose is to print the day of a given day-number
//num_day is a number (0-6) provided by user
//day is an array of day-names, i.e., Sunday, Monday, etc.
//returns the day-name based on num_day

	return day[num_day];  //returns the day-name based on num_day

	//I start the array at 0, rather than 1
