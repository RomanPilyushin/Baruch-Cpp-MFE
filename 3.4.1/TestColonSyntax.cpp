	When Line class does NOT use : syntax

	When Line class does use : syntax
	-->Number of point constructor, destructor, and assignment calls = 4.

	Basically, there's a significant increase in performance between using member initializer list vs member assignment.
	Performance slows using member assignment because the member data must first initialized with default constructors, and then
	reaassigned via assignment operator with actual values.  When using member initializer, the constructor (in my case an overload constructor)
	will be called once and the object will be constructed and initialized in one operation
